        <section class="start">

            <h2 id="getting-his-start">Getting his Start</h2>

            <p>Bass was born on the 8th May, 1920 in The Bronx, New York City. A creative child, he drew constantly - something he promoted heavily throughout his life. Growing up in the Depression, he had to leave school early at the age of 16 to work in a local advertising agency in order to support his Jewish immigrant parents and family. During this time, he attended night classes at his local college where he began studying under György Kepes. György Kepes was a Hungarian-born painter, photographer, designer, educator, and art theorist. Kepes was such a master of the Bauhaus aesthetic that he began teaching at the New Bauhaus in Chicago in 1937. Kepes focused Bass's ideas on modernism, the psychology of the audience and the social responsibility of designers. Kepes helped shape Bass into one of the most articulate members of his profession. In the 1940s, Bass left New York for LA. Bass would soon turn his experience in advertising into something much more – design.</p>

            <blockquote>"Design is thinking made visible."</blockquote>

            <h2>Cinematic Revolution</h2>

            <p>Bass worked in advertising until his first major break: a poster for the 1954 film, ‘Carmen Jones.’ The filmmakers decided to invite Bass to design the title credits after being so impressed with his title work. They unknowingly just made a game-changing decision for the industries of film and design.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="films">

            <img src="images/carmenjones.jpg" alt='Carmen Jones movie poster' class="carmenjones">
            <p class="caption">The Poster that changed it all</p>

            <p>Bass stepped up the sophistication of movie posters with his distinctive style: simple colour palettes and imagery that mimicked cut paper. This can be seen in many pieces of his work. Bass completely revolutionized the role of title credits in film. Credits were static and drab - they were projected onto the closed curtains as they were so unimportant.</p>

            <p>Bass, with his fresh eyes and love for design, seen an opportunity. He decided to inject life into the stereotypically drab graphics, ultimately making them as much a part of the cinematic experience as anything else. He aimed to "symbolise and summarise" the movie in the credits via imagery and text. His signature “kinetic type” (type that moved) became part of design history as they dashed and moved across the screen.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="kinetic">

            <p>Titles became a spectacle to be seen. Film reels with Bass credits were special occasions and a routine change for projectionists working in theatres. They came with a note: <em>“projectionist – pull curtain before titles.”</em></p>

            <p>During my research I watched the documentary 'Bass on Titles' (2006) It was here that I learnt that Bass approached each film title with the same three-point approach he would use with any of his design projects:</p>

            <ol class="points">
                <li>Saturating himself with knowledge of the company.</li>
                <li>Understanding the vision of the company.</li>
                <li>Never trying to symbolize a point of view.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="livedby"><b>These are the 3 points he lived by.</b></p>

            <p>His approach can be seen brilliantly in his next project for Otto Preminger, for the film 'The Man With the Golden Arm'. Preminger’s vision was to represent the reality of drug addiction without judging the morals of the main character. Hollywood often represented addicts as drug fiends and Otto wanted to challenge that perception. It was a vision that Bass knew would challenge the sensibilities of the audience so he sandwiched the credits between a series of straight and off-kilter lines. Bass seen his work for ‘The Man With the Golden Arm’ as an expression of the "disjointed, jarring existence of the drug addict." The audience knew they were about to witness a film that would step over the lines of traditional values due to Bass’ work. Saul Bass knew his work could "set up the mood and texture of the film." And it did.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="experiment">

            <h2 id="experimental-phase">The Experimental Phase</h2>

            <p>Many people regard 'the Man with the Golden Arm' as the peak of Bass’ career when it was really only the first of a series of film titles in the 50s and 60s that would increasingly stretch the boundaries of both technology and art. Enter: The Experimental Phase.</p>

            <p>Bass' title design portfolio included:</p>

            <ul class="experimental">
                <li>A 7-minute end credit for 'Around the World in Eight Days' (1956).</li>
                <li>The iconic titles for Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' (1958) which took the audience through a woman’s eye.</li>
                <li>A live action piece which further developed the idea of the film, 'The Big Country' (1958), as a mini story. The sequence acted as a prologue.</li>
                <li>The title credit sequence of 'West Side Story' (1961) which act as an epilogue.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="logos">

            <h2 id="logos-made-to-last">Logos made to last</h2>

            <blockquote>“If I do my job well, the identity program will also clean up the image of the company, position it as being contemporary and keep it from ever looking dated.”</blockquote>

            <p>The average lifespan of a Saul Bass logo is 34 years. 34 years. That's impressive. Some of his work has yet to be replaced, like the absolutely brilliant designs for Kibun (1964), Warner Communications (1972) and Geffen Records (1980). Bass set out to insure this would be the case through solid, thoughtful and timeless design.</p>

            <img src="images/saullogos.png" alt='Kibun, Warner Communications and Geffen Records logos' />

            <p>Even some of his designs that have been tweaked or re-branded are still key pieces of design history and are viewed as vicious examples of great graphic design.</p>

            <blockquote>"The ideal trademark is one that is pushed to its utmost limits in terms of abstraction and ambiguity, yet is still readable. Trademarks are usually metaphors of one kind or another. And are, in a certain sense, thinking made visible."</blockquote>

            <p>As many do halfway through their career, Saul wanted something more. He began looking for a new creative outlet for his talents and passion. The answer proved to be film-making: imaginative documentaries, a single feature film (Phase IV, 1979), and of course he continued to create title sequences for other directors' work like before. Bass continued working throughout film, graphic design and TV and created the ultimate legacy for himself working until his death in. Many view Bass as the most important graphic designer of the 20th century.</p>

        <section class="influence">

            <h2 id="his-influence-today">His Influence Today</h2>

            <p>A mammoth name must have a mammoth legacy. His influence today has cast a wide net. Every movie you watch that has creative credits - thank Saul Bass. His influence can also be seen very clearly in the work of many contemporary artists. Steven Spielberg's 'Catch Me If You Can' shows clear links to Saul Bass' graphic style as does 'Dexter' the popular TV show.</p>

            <div class="intrinsic-container intrinsic-container-16x9">
                <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/17112720" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p id="afteriframe">Title sequences such as The Walking Dead and The X-Files set the mood for what is to come. An idea that Saul Bass first established. To us, it seems like common sense but only because nearly every movie and TV-show uses the technique in our modern times. What seems to be our common sense has been engrained in us due to Saul Bass!</p>

            <p>Likewise, Saul Bass was also known for using titles sequences of epilogues and prologues helping to establish the story, the world and the characters before it has even begun. The most prevalent contemporary example of this is the Game Of Thrones title sequence which shows us the known world, focuses in on the locations of that particular episode while also communicating the progressive rise and fall of each house as it plays out on the mechanical game board.</p>

            <img src="images/allstate.png" alt="Allstate Ad inspired by Saul Bass" title="Allstate Advertisement." class='allstate' />

            <p>Allstate Insurance have even got in on the Saul Bass legacy with an ad campaign designed by Leo Burnett/Chicago. It sports uneven colours and graphic shapes that mimic the way Bass would utilize graphics.</p>

            <p>And of course, the ultimate sign of fame and legacy - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64lDaAmpvSo" class="google">a Google Doodle.</a> For his 93rd Birthday on May 8th, 2008 Google created a Bass homage displaying his best-loved works. The doodle can be viewed here. It was designed by Matthew Cruickshank who said "From the outset, I wanted to celebrate a number of his film credits in succinct succession, as well as a nod in the direction of his poster work. Corresponding with Jennifer Bass was inspirational and led to hearing that Saul Bass was a Dave Brubeck fan." The Google Doodle was then put to the sound of a Dave Brubeck track which matched perfectly with the animation. The fact that the Dave Brubeck and every studio was happy to help Cruickshank shows just how well-respected Saul Bass is and how his work still has an impact today.</p>

            <p>I have noticed Bass' direct influence on modern day pop culture. One of my favourite movies of all time (actually from when I was 2 in 2001) is Monsters Inc. While investigating and admiring Bass' work I immediately though of the title sequence for Monsters Inc. The distinct style shows large amounts of Bass influence. From the oddly cut paper-like shapes to the foreboding of the story that is to become. It is clearly a bow to Saul Bass.</p>

            <p id="afteriframe">Furthermore, Bass has inspired a generation of young designers when creating their own pieces of art. Designers Andres Schiling and Alex Clark both created posters in the style of Bass, as seen below.</p>

            <ul id="posters">

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ulrika Johnson's Bass inspired work is one of the most noteable salutes to Bass. A student brief in the Graphic Design course at Shillington College was to create a concept for an exhibition of Saul Bass’s art, including exhibition tickets and souvenirs for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Australia.</p>

            <ul id="ulrika">
                <li><img src="images/inf_erika_poster2.jpg" alt="Second Poster by Ulrika Johnson">
                    <p class="caption">One of Ulrika's posters</p>
                </li>
                <li><img src="images/inf_erika_popcorn.jpg" alt="Popcorn boxes in the style of Bass">
                    <p class="caption">Ulrika's Popcorn Boxes which are a play on Bass' famous sayings and would be used at Bass' favourite place - the movies!</p>
                </li>
                <li><img src="images/inf_erika_postcard.jpg" alt="Postcards in the style of Bass">
                    <p class="caption">One of Ulrika's proposed souvenirs</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ulrika's work features the style of Bass, some of his most famous quotes, references to his most well-known work such as the eye which is seen in Alred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' and the globe from the titles of 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.' I love these pieces as they show off Bass' work and life while still having their own unique identity.</p>

            <p>Bass died in 1996 on the 25th of April of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His wife-and creative partner, Elaine, survived him, following 35 years of happy marriage and creative work together. They had two children, Jennifer and Jeffrey. His daughter has written a biography which displayed and analysed Bass' work 'Saul Bass: A Life in Film and Design Book.'</p>
